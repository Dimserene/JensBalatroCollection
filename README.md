# JensBalatroCollection
Collection of mods I've made for Balatro

- **Aurinko** : Lets planets naturally appear with editions. Editioned cards apply their edition effects when leveling up/down hands.
- **Incantation** : Consolidates identical consumables into a single card to save space.
- **Loop** : Adds a voucher which unredeems certain vouchers to let them be re-redeemed again for stacking effects.
- **Nopeus** : Adds more speed options, including a special x999 speed which makes all events run as fast as possible.
- **Jen's Almanac** : An extension of the mod [Cryptid](https://github.com/MathIsFun0/Cryptid) which causes complete pandemonium.
