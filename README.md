# JensBalatroCollection
Collection of mods I've made for Balatro

- **Aurinko** : Lets planets naturally appear with editions. Editioned cards apply their edition effects when leveling up/down hands.
- **Incantation** : Consolidates identical consumables into a single card to save space.
- **Loop** : Adds a voucher which unredeems certain vouchers to let them be re-redeemed again for stacking effects.
- **Nopeus** : Adds more speed options.
- **Jen's Almanac** : An extension of the mod [Cryptid](https://github.com/MathIsFun0/Cryptid) which causes complete pandemonium.

# Wait, where is Jen's Almanac?
I removed it from GitHub because I need to reduce my workload; I'm juggling tons of things at once and trying to manage a lot of files simultaneously on GitHub, trying to remember what needs updating and what doesn't, is pretty difficult. You can still find Jen's Almanac in the [official Balatro Discord](https://discord.com/channels/1116389027176787968/1262697083438235729) or the [Cryptid Discord](https://discord.gg/eUf9Ur6RyB).
